<h1>SQL Tutorial</h1>
<h1>Introduction to SQL</h1>
<p>SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating <databases class="h4">What is SQL?</databases></p>

<p>SQL stands for Structured Query Language
    SQL lets you access and manipulate databases
    SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987
    </p>
    <h4>What Can SQL do?</h4>
    <p>SQL can execute queries against a database
        SQL can retrieve data from a database
        SQL can insert records in a database
        SQL can update records in a database
        SQL can delete records from a database
        SQL can create new databases
        SQL can create new tables in a database
        SQL can create stored procedures in a database
        SQL can create views in a database
        SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views</p>
        <h4>SQL is a Standard - BUT....</h4>
        <p>Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.

            However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner.</p>
        <h4>Using SQL in Your Web Site</h4>
        <p>To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:

            An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)
            To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP
            To use SQL to get the data you want
            To use HTML / CSS to style the page
            </p>
            <h1>SQL Syntax
            </h1>
            <h4>SQL Statements</h4>
            <p>Most of the actions you need to perform on a database are done with SQL statements.

                SQL statements consists of keywords that are easy to understand.
                
                The following SQL statement returns all records from a table named "Customers":</p>
                <h4>Semicolon after SQL Statements?</h4>
                <p>Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.

                    Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.
                    
                    In this tutorial, we will use semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.
                    
                    </p>
                    <h4>Some of The Most Important SQL Commands</h4>
                    <p>SELECT - extracts data from a database
                        UPDATE - updates data in a database
                        DELETE - deletes data from a database
                        INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
                        CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
                        ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
                        CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
                        ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
                        DROP TABLE - deletes a table
                        CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
                        DROP INDEX - deletes an index</p>
                        <h1>SQL SELECT Statement</h1>
                        <h4>The SQL SELECT Statement</h4>
                        <h4>Syntax</h4>
                        <p class="tip">SELECT column1, column2, ...
                            FROM table_name;</p>
                            <p>Here, column1, column2, ... are the field names of the table you want to select data from.

                                The table_name represents the name of the table you want to select data from.</p>
                                <h4>SQL SELECT DISTINCT Statement</h4>
                                <h4>Syntax</h4>
                                <p class="tip">SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
                                    FROM table_name;
                                    
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Count Distinct</h4>
                                    <p>By using the DISTINCT keyword in a function called COUNT, we can return the number of different countries.</p>
                                    <p class="tip">Note: The COUNT(DISTINCT column_name) is not supported in Microsoft Access databases.</p>
                                    <h1>SQL WHERE Clause</h1>
                                    <h4>The SQL WHERE Clause</h4>
                                    <p>The WHERE clause is used to filter records.

                                        It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.</p>
                                        <p class="tip">Note: The WHERE clause is not only used in SELECT statements, it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE, etc.!</p>
                                        <h4>Text Fields vs. Numeric Fields</h4>
                                        <p>SQL requires single quotes around text values (most database systems will also allow double quotes).

                                            However, numeric fields should not be enclosed in quotes:</p>
                                            <h4>Operators in The WHERE Clause</h4>
                                            <p>You can use other operators than the = operator to filter the search.</p>
                                            <h1>SQL ORDER BY Keyword</h1>
                                            <h4>The SQL ORDER BY</h4>
                                            <p>The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.</p>
                                            <h4>Syntax</h4>
                                            <p class="tip">SELECT column1, column2, ...
                                                FROM table_name
                                                ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;</p>
                                                <h4>DESC</h4>
                                                <p>The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.</p>
<h4>Order Alphabetically</h4>
<p>For string values the ORDER BY keyword will order alphabetically:</p>
<h4>ORDER BY Several Columns</h4>
<p>The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted by the "Country" and the "CustomerName" column. This means that it orders by Country, but if some rows have the same Country, it orders them by CustomerName:</p>

<h4>Using Both ASC and DESC</h4>
<p>The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted ascending by the "Country" and descending by the "CustomerName" column:</p>
<h1>SQL AND Operator</h1>
<h4>The SQL AND Operator</h4>
<p>The WHERE clause can contain one or many AND operators.

    The AND operator is used to filter records based on more than one condition, like if you want to return all customers from Spain that starts with the letter 'G':</p>
    <h4>Syntax</h4>
    <p>SELECT column1, column2, ...
        FROM table_name
        WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;</p>
        <h4>AND vs OR</h4>
        <p class="tip">The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions are TRUE.

            The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions are TRUE.</p>
            <h4>All Conditions Must Be True</h4>
            <p>The following SQL statement selects all fields from Customers where Country is "Germany" AND City is "Berlin" AND PostalCode is higher than 12000:</p>
            <h4>Combining AND and OR</h4>
            <p>You can combine the AND and OR operators.

                The following SQL statement selects all customers from Spain that starts with a "G" or an "R".
                
                Make sure you use parenthesis to get the correct result.</p>
                <h1>SQL OR Operator</h1>
                <h4>The SQL OR Operator</h4>
                <p>The WHERE clause can contain one or more OR operators.

                    The OR operator is used to filter records based on more than one condition, like if you want to return all customers from Germany but also those from Spain:</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p class="tip">SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;</p>
    <h4>OR vs AND</h4>
    <p class="tip">The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions are TRUE.

        The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions are TRUE.</p>
        <h1>SQL NOT Operator</h1>
        <h4>The NOT Operator</h4>
        <p>The NOT operator is used in combination with other operators to give the opposite result, also called the negative result.

            In the select statement below we want to return all customers that are NOT from Spain:</p>
            <h4>Syntax</h4>
            <p class="tip">SELECT column1, column2, ...
                FROM table_name
                WHERE NOT condition;</p>
                <h1>SQL INSERT INTO Statement</h1>
                <h4>The SQL INSERT INTO Statement</h4>
                <p>The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table.

                    INSERT INTO Syntax
                    It is possible to write the INSERT INTO statement in two ways:
                    
                    1. Specify both the column names and the values to be inserted:
                    
                    INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
                    VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);</p>
                    <p>2. If you are adding values for all the columns of the table, you do not need to specify the column names in the SQL query. However, make sure the order of the values is in the same order as the columns in the table. Here, the INSERT INTO syntax would be as follows:</p>
                    <p class="tip">INSERT INTO table_name
                        VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);</p>
                        <h4>Insert Data Only in Specified Columns</h4>
                        <p>It is also possible to only insert data in specific columns.

                            The following SQL statement will insert a new record, but only insert data in the "CustomerName", "City", and "Country" columns (CustomerID will be updated automatically):</p>


<h4>Insert Multiple Rows</h4>
<p>It is also possible to insert multiple rows in one statement.

    To insert multiple rows of data, we use the same INSERT INTO statement, but with multiple values:</p>
    <h1>SQL NULL Values</h1>
    <h4>What is a NULL Value?</h4>
    <p>A field with a NULL value is a field with no value.

        If a field in a table is optional, it is possible to insert a new record or update a record without adding a value to this field. Then, the field will be saved with a NULL value.</p>
        <p class="tip">Note: A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation!</p>
        <h4>How to Test for NULL Values?</h4>
        <p>It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>.

            We will have to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead.</p>
            <h4>IS NULL Syntax</h4>
            <p class="tip">SELECT column_names
                FROM table_name
                WHERE column_name IS NULL;</p>
                <h4>IS NOT NULL Syntax</h4>
                <p class="tip">SELECT column_names
                    FROM table_name
                    WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;</p>
                    <h4>The IS NULL Operator</h4>
                    <p>The IS NULL operator is used to test for empty values (NULL values).

                        The following SQL lists all customers with a NULL value in the "Address" field:</p>
                        <h1>SQL UPDATE Statement</h1>
                        <h4>The SQL UPDATE Statement</h4>
                        <p class="tip">UPDATE table_name
                            SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
                            WHERE condition;</p>
                            <p class="tip">Note: Be careful when updating records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the UPDATE statement. The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) that should be updated. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be updated!</p>
                            <h4>UPDATE Multiple Records</h4>
                            <p>It is the WHERE clause that determines how many records will be updated.

                                The following SQL statement will update the ContactName to "Juan" for all records where country is "Mexico":</p>
<h4>Update Warning!</h4>
<p class="tip">Be careful when updating records. If you omit the WHERE clause, ALL records will be updated!</p>
<h1>SQL DELETE Statement</h1>
<h4>The SQL DELETE Statement</h4>
<p>The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.</p>

<h4>DELETE Syntax</h4>
<p class="tip">DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;</p>
<p class="tip">Note: Be careful when deleting records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the DELETE statement. The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) should be deleted. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be deleted!</p>
<h4>Delete All Records</h4>
<p>It is possible to delete all rows in a table without deleting the table. This means that the table structure, attributes, and indexes will be intact:</p>
<p class="tip">DELETE FROM table_name;</p>
<h1>SQL MIN() and MAX() Functions</h1>
<h4>The SQL MIN() and MAX() Functions</h4>
<p>The MIN() function returns the smallest value of the selected column.

    The MAX() function returns the largest value of the selected column</p>
    <h4>Syntax</h4>
    <p class="tip">SELECT MIN(column_name)
        FROM table_name
        WHERE condition;
        
        SELECT MAX(column_name)
        FROM table_name
        WHERE condition;</p>
        <h1>SQL COUNT() Function</h1>
        <h4>The SQL COUNT() Function</h4>
        <p>The COUNT() function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criterion.</p>
        <h4>Syntax</h4>
        <p class="tip">SELECT COUNT(column_name)
            FROM table_name
            WHERE condition;
            
            </p>
            <h4>Add a Where Clause</h4>
            <p>You can add a WHERE clause to specify conditions:</p>
            <h4>Specify Column</h4>
            <p>You can specify a column name instead of the asterix symbol (*).

                If you specify a column instead of (*), NULL values will not be counted.</p>
                <h1>SQL SUM() Function</h1>
                <h4>The SQL SUM() Function</h4>
                <p>The SUM() function returns the total sum of a numeric column.</p>
                <h4>Syntax</h4>
                <p class="tip">SELECT SUM(column_name)
                    FROM table_name
                    WHERE condition;</p>
                    <h4>Add a Where Clause</h4>
                    <p>You can add a WHERE clause to specify conditions:</p>
                    <h1>SQL AVG() Function</h1>
                    <h4>The SQL AVG() Function</h4>
                    <p>The AVG() function returns the average value of a numeric column.</p>
                    <h4>Syntax</h4>
                    <p class="tip">SELECT AVG(column_name)
                        FROM table_name
                        WHERE condition;</p>
                        <h1>SQL LIKE Operator</h1>
                        <h4>The SQL LIKE Operator</h4>
                        <p>The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

                            There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:
                            
                             The percent sign % represents zero, one, or multiple characters
                             The underscore sign _ represents one, single character</p>
                             <h4>Syntax</h4>
                             <p class="tip">SELECT column1, column2, ...
                                FROM table_name
                                WHERE columnN LIKE pattern</p>
                                <h4>The _ Wildcard</h4>
                                <p>The _ wildcard represents a single character.

                                    It can be any character or number, but each _ represents one, and only one, character.</p>
                                    <h4>SQL Wildcards</h4>
<h4>SQL Wildcard Characters</h4>
<p>A wildcard character is used to substitute one or more characters in a string.

    Wildcard characters are used with the LIKE operator. The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.</p>
    <h4>Using the _ Wildcard</h4>
    <p>The _ wildcard represents a single character.

        It can be any character or number, but each _ represents one, and only one, character.</p>
        <h4>Using the [] Wildcard</h4>

<p>The [] wildcard returns a result if any of the characters inside gets a match.</p>
<h1>SQL IN Operator</h1>
<h4>The SQL IN Operator</h4>
<p>The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.

    The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.</p>
    <h4>Syntax</h4>
    <p class="tip">SELECT column_name(s)
        FROM table_name
        WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);</p>
        <h1>SQL BETWEEN Operator</h1>
        <h4>The SQL BETWEEN Operator</h4>
        <p>The BETWEEN operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates.

            The BETWEEN operator is inclusive: begin and end values are included. </p>
            <h4>Syntax</h4>
            <p class="tip">SELECT column_name(s)

                <h4>SQL Aliases</h4>
                <p>SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.

                    Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.
                    
                    An alias only exists for the duration of that query.
                    
                    An alias is created with the AS keyword.</p>
                    <h4>AS is Optional</h4>
                    <p>Actually, in most database languages, you can skip the AS keyword and get the same result:</p>

                            SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + ISNULL(UnitsOnOrder, 0))
                            FROM Products;
                            or we can use the COALESCE() function, like this:
                            
                            SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + COALESCE(UnitsOnOrder, 0))
                            FROM Products;
                            MS Access
                            
                            The MS Access IsNull() function returns TRUE (-1) if the expression is a null value, otherwise FALSE (0):
                            
                            SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + IIF(IsNull(UnitsOnOrder), 0, UnitsOnOrder))
                            FROM Products;
                            Oracle
                            
                            The Oracle NVL() function achieves the same result:
                            
                            SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + NVL(UnitsOnOrder, 0))
                            FROM Products;
                            or we can use the COALESCE() function, like this:
                            
                            SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + COALESCE(UnitsOnOrder, 0))
                            FROM Products;
                            </p>
                            <h1>SQL Comments</h1>
                            <p>SQL Comments
                                Comments are used to explain sections of SQL statements, or to prevent execution of SQL statements.
                                
                                Note: Comments are not supported in Microsoft Access databases!</p>
                                <h4>Single Line Comments</h4>
                                <p>Single line comments start with --.

                                    Any text between -- and the end of the line will be ignored (will not be executed).
                                    
                                    The following example uses a single-line comment as an explanation:</p>

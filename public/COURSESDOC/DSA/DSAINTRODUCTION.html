                    This tutorial will give you a solid foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms, an essential skill for any software developer.</p>
             <h4>What You Should Already Know</h4>
             <p>Although Data Structures and Algorithms is actually not specific to any programming language, you should have a basic understanding of programming in one of these common programming languages:
        
                Python
                C
                C++
                Java
                JavaScript</p>
                <h4>DSA History</h4>
                <p>The word 'algorithm' comes from 'al-Khwarizmi', named after a Persian scholar who lived around year 800.
        
                    The concept of algorithmic problem-solving can be traced back to ancient times, long before the invention of computers.
                    
                    The study of Data Structures and Algorithms really took off with the invention of computers in the 1940s, to efficiently manage and process data.
                    
                    Today, DSA is a key part of Computer Science education and professional programming, helping us to create faster and more powerful software.</p>
                    <h1>Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms</h1>
                    <p class="tip">Data Structures is about how data can be stored in different structures.
        
                        Algorithms is about how to solve different problems, often by searching through and manipulating data structures.
                        
                        Theory about Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) helps us to use large amounts of data to solve problems efficiently.</p>
                        <h4>What are Data Structures?</h4>
                        <p>A data structure is a way to store data.
        
                            We structure data in different ways depending on what data we have, and what we want to do with it.
                            
                            Family Tree
                            Family tree
                            First, let's consider an example without computers in mind, just to get the idea.
                            
                            If we want to store data about people we are related to, we use a family tree as the data structure. We choose a family tree as the data structure because we have information about people we are related to and how they are related, and we want an overview so that we can easily find a specific family member, several generations back.
                            
                            With such a family tree data structure visually in front of you, it is easy to see, for example, who my mother's mother isâ€”it is 'Emma,' right? But without the links from child to parents that this data structure provides, it would be difficult to determine how the individuals are related.
                            
                            Data structures give us the possibility to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services.
                            
                            Data structures are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms. They help in managing and organizing data, reduce complexity, and increase efficiency.</p>
                            <p class="tip">In Computer Science there are two different kinds of data structures.
        
                                Primitive Data Structures are basic data structures provided by programming languages to represent single values, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans.
                                
                                Abstract Data Structures are higher-level data structures that are built using primitive data types and provide more complex and specialized operations. Some common examples of abstract data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.</p>
                                <h4>What are Algorithms?</h4>
        <p>An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions to solve a given problem or achieve a specific goal.
        
            Pommes Frites Recipe
            Pommes Frites Recipe
            A cooking recipe written on a piece of paper is an example of an algorithm, where the goal is to make a certain dinner. The steps needed to make a specific dinner are described exactly.
            
            When we talk about algorithms in Computer Science, the step-by-step instructions are written in a programming language, and instead of food ingredients, an algorithm uses data structures.
            
            Algorithms are fundamental to computer programming as they provide step-by-step instructions for executing tasks. An efficient algorithm can help us to find the solution we are looking for, and to transform a slow program into a faster one.
            
            By studying algorithms, developers can write better 
            
            Algorithm examples:
            
            Finding the fastest route in a GPS navigation system
            Navigating an airplane or a car (cruise control)
            Finding what users search for (search engine)
            Sorting, for example sorting movies by rating
            The algorithms we will look at in this tutorial are designed to solve specific problems, and are often made to work on specific data structures. For example, the 'Bubble Sort' algorithm is designed to sort values, and is made to work on arrays.</p>
            <img src="/img/AWS/img_pommesfrites.png" alt="">    
            <h4>Data Structures together with Algorithms</h4>
            <p>Data structures and algorithms (DSA) go hand in hand. A data structure is not worth much if you cannot search through it or manipulate it efficiently using algorithms, and the algorithms in this tutorial are not worth much without a data structure to work on.
        
                DSA is about finding efficient ways to store and retrieve data, to perform operations on data, and to solve specific problems.
                
                By understanding DSA, you can:
                
                Decide which data structure or algorithm is best for a given situation.
                Make programs that run faster or use less memory.
                Understand how to approach complex problems and solve them in a systematic way.</p>
                <h4>Where is Data Structures and Algorithms Needed?</h4>
                <p class="tip">Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are used in virtually every software system, from operating systems to web applications:
        
                    For managing large amounts of data, such as in a social network or a search engine.
                    For scheduling tasks, to decide which task a computer should do first.
                    For planning routes, like in a GPS system to find the shortest path from A to B.
                    For optimizing processes, such as arranging tasks so they can be completed as quickly as possible.
                    For solving complex problems: From finding the best way to pack a truck to making a computer 'learn' from data.</p>
                    <p class="tip">DSA is fundamental in nearly every part of the software world:
        
                        Operating Systems
                        Database Systems
                        Web Applications
                        Machine Learning
                        Video Games
                        Cryptographic Systems
                        Data Analysis
                        Search Engines</p>
                        <h1>A Simple Algorithm</h1>
                        <h4>Fibonacci Numbers</h4>
                        <p>The Fibonacci numbers are very useful for introducing algorithms, so before we continue, here is a short introduction to Fibonacci numbers.
        
                            The Fibonacci numbers are named after a 13th century Italian mathematician known as Fibonacci.
                            
                            The two first Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1, and the next Fibonacci number is always the sum of the two previous numbers, so we get 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...    </p>
        
        <h4>The Fibonacci Number Algorithm</h4>
        <p>To generate a Fibonacci number, all we need to do is to add the two previous Fibonacci numbers.
        
            The Fibonacci numbers is a good way of demonstrating what an algorithm is. We know the principle of how to find the next number, so we can write an algorithm to create as many Fibonacci numbers as possible.
            
            Below is the algorithm to create the 20 first Fibonacci numbers.</p>
            <p class="tip">How it works:
        
                Start with the two first Fibonacci numbers 0 and 1.
                Add the two previous numbers together to create a new Fibonacci number.
                Update the value of the two previous numbers.
                Do point a and b above 18 times.</p>
                <h4>Loops vs Recursion</h4>
                <p>To show the difference between loops and recursion, we will implement solutions to find Fibonacci numbers in three different ways:
        
                    An implementation of the Fibonacci algorithm above using a for loop.
                    An implementation of the Fibonacci algorithm above using recursion.
                    Finding the 
                    n
                    th Fibonacci number using recursion.
                    1. Implementation Using a For Loop
                    It can be a good idea to list what the code must contain or do before programming it:
                    
                    Two variables to hold the previous two Fibonacci numbers
                    A for loop that runs 18 times
                    Create new Fibonacci numbers by adding the two previous ones
                    Print the new Fibonacci number
                    Update the variables that hold the previous two fibonacci numbers</p>
                    <p>2. Implementation Using Recursion
                        Recursion is when a function calls itself.
                        
                        To implement the Fibonacci algorithm we need most of the same things as in the code example above, but we need to replace the for loop with recursion.
                        
                        To replace the for loop with recursion, we need to encapsulate much of the code in a function, and we need the function to call itself to create a new Fibonacci number as long as the produced number of Fibonacci numbers is below, or equal to, 19.</p>
                        <p>3. Finding The 
                            n
                            th Fibonacci Number Using Recursion
                            To find the 
                            n
                            th Fibonacci number we can write code based on the mathematic formula for Fibonacci number 
                            n
                            :
                            
                            F
                            (
                            n
                            )
                            =
                            F
                            (
                            n
                            âˆ’
                            1
                            )
                            +
                            F
                            (
                            n
                            âˆ’
                            2
                            )
                            
                            This just means that for example the 10th Fibonacci number is the sum of the 9th and 8th Fibonacci numbers.</p>
                            <h1>DSA Arrays</h1>
                            <h4>Arrays</h4>
                            <p>
                                An array is a data structure used to store multiple elements.
                                
                                Arrays are used by many algorithms.
                                
                                For example, an algorithm can be used to look through an array to find the lowest value, like the animation below shows:</p>
            <p class="tip">Note: The Python code above actually generates a Python 'list' data type, but for the scope of this tutorial the 'list' data type can be used in the same way as an array. Learn more about Python lists here.</p>
            <h4>Algorithm: Find The Lowest Value in an Array</h4>
            <p>Let's create our first algorithm using the array data structure.
        
                Below is the algorithm to find the lowest number in an array.</p>
                <p class="tip">How it works:
        
                    Go through the values in the array one by one.
                    Check if the current value is the lowest so far, and if it is, store it.
                    After looking at all the values, the stored value will be the lowest of all values in the array.</p>
                    <h4>Implementation</h4>
                    <p>Before implementing the algorithm using an actual programming language, it is usually smart to first write the algorithm as a step-by-step procedure.
        
                        If you can write down the algorithm in something between human language and programming language, the algorithm will be easier to implement later because we avoid drowning in all the details of the programming language syntax.</p><p class="tip">Create a variable 'minVal' and set it equal to the first value of the array.
                            Go through every element in the array.
                            If the current element has a lower value than 'minVal', update 'minVal' to this value.
                            After looking at all the elements in the array, the 'minVal' variable now contains the lowest value.</p>
                            <p>You can also write the algorithm in a way that looks more like a programming language if you want to, like this:</p>
                            <p class="tip">Variable 'minVal' = array[0]
                                For each element in the array
                                    If current element < minVal
                                        minVal = current element</p>
                                        <p class="tip">Note: The two step-by-step descriptions of the algorithm we have written above can be called 'pseudocode'. Pseudocode is a description of what a program does, using language that is something between human language and a programming language.</p>
                                        <h4>Algorithm Time Complexity</h4>
                                        <p>When exploring algorithms, we often look at how long time an algorithm takes to run relative to the size of the data set.
        
                                            In the example above, the time the algorithm needs to run is proportional, or linear, to the size of the data set. This is because the algorithm must visit every array element one time to find the lowest value. The loop must run 5 times since there are 5 values in the array. And if the array had 1000 values, the loop would have to run 1000 times.
                                            
                                            Try the simulation below to see this relationship between the number of compare operations needed to find the lowest value, and the size of the array.
                                            
                                            See this page for a more thorough explanation of what time complexity is.
                                            
                                            Each algorithm in this tutorial will be presented together with its time complexity.</p>

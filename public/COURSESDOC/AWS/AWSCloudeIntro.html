        <h4>The Client-Server Model</h4>
        <p>The client-server model is an important concept in cloud computing.

            It is about many clients using services from a centralized server.
        </p>
        <h4>What is the Client-Server Model?</h4>
        <p>The Client-Server model is about a client that interacts and makes requests to a computer server.

            A client is the way that the person interact with the server.</p>

        <img src="/img/AWS/clientservermodel (1).png" alt="">
        <p>Image created by Amazon Web Services

            The server does tasks for the client and returns information.</p>
        <h4>What is Cloud Computing?</h4>
        <p>Cloud computing is a computing service made available over the internet.

            Cloud computing is a pay-as-you-go model for delivering IT resources.

            You pay only for what you use.</p>
        <h1>Deployment Models</h1>
        <p>There are three different kinds of deployment models:

            Cloud-based
            On-premises
            Hybrid
            The models are different ways of accessing compute services - over the internet, locally, or in a
            combination.
        </p>
        <h4>Cloud-Based Deployment</h4>
        <p>Everything runs in the cloud.

            This model allows you to build new applications or move existing ones to the cloud.

            There are different levels of services ranging from low to high.

            The level of service has different requirements on your management, architecting, and infrastructure.

            For example, a company might create an application consisting of virtual servers, databases, and networking
            components entirely based in the cloud.</p>


        <h4>On-Premises Deployment</h4>
        <p>Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools.

        <p class="tip"> On-Premises Deployment is also known as private cloud deployment.
        </p>
        For example, you might have applications that run on technology that is fully kept in your on-premises data
        center.

        Though this model is much like legacy IT infrastructure, its application management and virtualization
        technologies make it more effective.</p>

    </section>
    <h4>Hybrid Deployment</h4>
    <p>In a hybrid deployment, you connect cloud resources to an on-premises infrastructure.

        This approach is relevant in many situations.</p>
    <p class="tip">For example, you are working with sensitive data or are under specific government regulations.</p>

    <h1>AWS Cloud Benefits</h1>
    <h4>Why Choose Cloud Computing?</h4>
    <p>There are many reasons for going with the cloud.

        Cloud computing enables benefits such as:

        Cost savings
        Security
        Scalability
        Flexibility</p>
    <h4>Payment Model</h4>
    <p>The cloud payment model is flexible.

        You do not have to invest in a data center, servers, and other resources.

        The cloud services is a variable expense.

        You can use the services from the start and consume more as you grow.</p>

    <h4>Fewer Operations</h4>
    <p>Having your own data centers and servers requires resources and staffing.

        Cloud computing reduces operation and lets you focus on important things, such as your applications and
        customers.</p>

    <h4>Flexible Capacity</h4>
    <p>Having and managing your own servers can result in unused capacity and limitations.

        On the other hand, you can grow freely with cloud computing.

        You pay for what you use

    </p>
    <h4>Economies at Scale</h4>
    <p>Cloud computing is about shared resources.

        Sharing the infrastructure cost with hundreds of thousands of other customers lowers the overall costs.

    </p>
    <h4>Increased Speed

    </h4>
    <p>The flexibility of cloud computing makes it easier to develop and deploy applications.

        You can test and utilize resources as you want in minutes.

        This freedom allows you to experiment and invent more.

        It allows for instant resource access.</p>
    <h4>Global Reach</h4>
    <p>AWS has data centers all over the world.

        The AWS Cloud's global reach allows you to swiftly deploy apps to consumers anywhere.

        Customers can access your apps quickly.

        You can pick the ones near your clients to reduce the latency.

    </p>
    <h1>AWS Cloud EC2
    </h1>
    <h4>AWS EC2 - Virtual Cloud Server</h4>
    <p>EC2 is a virtual server in the AWS Cloud.

        AWS EC2 is short for AWS Elastic Cloud Compute.

        It makes scaling of capacity up and down easy.</p>
    <h4>Why AWS EC2?</h4>
    <p>It makes the process of increasing and decreasing capacity easier.

        As a result, you can access the resources at demand.

        No upfront investment is needed.

        You only pay for what you need.

        EC2 is secure.</p>
    <h4>Get Started With AWS EC2</h4>
    <p>You can get started with EC2 in three steps.

    </p>
    <h4>1. Launch</h4>
    <p>Start with selecting a template with basic configurations.

        The config includes the operating system, application server, or applications.

        Next, decide the instance type and hardware configuration of your instance.

        Finally, specify the security settings to control the traffic in and out of your instance.</p>


    <p class="tip">You will learn more about cloud security later in this tutorial.</p>
    <h4>2. Connect</h4>
    <p>There are many ways to connect an instance.

        Programs and applications have multiple connection methods to exchange data.

        Users can connect and access the computer desktop by logging in</p>
    <h4>3. Use</h4>
    <p>Once connected, you can use the instance.

        Execute commands to install software, add storage, copy, and organize files, and much more.

    </p>
    <h1>AWS Cloud EC2 Instance Types</h1>

    <h4>AWS EC2 Instance Types</h4>
    <p>There are different instance types.

        Which one to use depends on the needs.</p>
    <h4>More About EC2 Instance Types</h4>
    <p>The types are best used for different things.

        Therefore, when selecting an instance type, consider the needs.

        For example, needs can be a requirement for compute, memory, or storage.</p>
    <h4>General Purpose Instance</h4>
    <p>The General Purpose Instance balances computing, memory, and networking resources.

        It fits many purposes. Such as:

        Application servers
        Gaming servers
        Backend servers for companies
        Small and medium databases
        The General Purpose Instances are best when there is a balance between the resources.</p>
    <h4>Compute Optimized Instances</h4>
    <p>The Compute Optimized Instances are best there is a need for high compute.

        This type is also good for application servers, gaming servers, and web applications.

        The main difference is that this type is ideal for high-performance and compute-intensive needs.</p>

    <h4>Memory Optimized Instances</h4>
    <p>This type can deliver large dataset workloads fast.

        Memory is a temporary storage area.

        It loads from storage, holds the data, and processes it before the computer can run it.

        The processing allows for a preloading process and gives the CPU direct access to the computer program.

        The Memory Optimized Instances are best when huge amounts of data need to be preloaded before running the app.
    </p>

    <h4>Accelerated Computing Instances</h4>
    <p>This type use hardware accelerators.

        The accelerators boost the data processing.

        The Accelerated Computing Instances are best for graphics applications and streaming.</p>
    <h4>Storage Optimized Instances</h4>
    <p>This type is best when you have large datasets on local storage.

        Some examples:

        Large file systems
        Data warehouses
        Online transaction systems
        The Storage Optimized Instances are designed to deliver many inputs as fast as possible.</p>
    <h4>AWS Cloud EC2 Pricing</h4>
    <p>With AWS EC2 you pay for the compute time.

        You only pay for the compute time that you use.

        It offers different pricing options.</p>
    <h4>On Demand Instances</h4>
    <p>On Demand Instances are best used for short-term workloads.

        It requires no upfront costs or minimum amount on the purchase.

        The instances run until you stop them.

        You pay for what you use.</p>
    <h4>AWS EC2 Savings Plan</h4>
    <p>The savings plan is a commitment for usage over a 1-year or 3-year term.

        Committing to a period gives a discounted price.

        If you surpass the budget, the cost goes to normal (on-demand) prices.</p>
    <p class="tip">You will learn more about AWS Cost Explorer later in this tutorial.

        AWS Cost Explorer is a tool that helps to plan usage with AWS Cloud.</p>
    <h4>Reserved Instances</h4>
    <p>The Reserved Instances are used to reserve instances for an agreed period.

        The options are for 1-year or 3-years. The latter one gives the highest discount.</p>

    <h4>Spot Instances</h4>
    <p>This pricing model is best for workloads with flexible start and end times, which can take interruptions.

        Spot instances can give up to a 90% cost savings.

        The reason behind the discount is that AWS can optimize its capacity, giving you better prices.</p>

    <h4>Dedicated Hosts</h4>
    <p>Dedicated hosts are physical servers fully dedicated to you.

        You can use your existing VM software licenses.

        The Dedicated Host is the most expensive model.</p>

    <h1>AWS Cloud EC2 Scaling</h1>
    <h4>AWS EC2 Scaling</h4>
    <p>Scaling is about only using the resources that you need.

        In addition, have the flexibility to grow freely.

        Make sure to have an architecture that can handle changes in demand.

        Designing a scalable architecture allow you to only pay for the resources that you need at any given time.

    </p>
    <h4>AWS EC2 Auto Scaling</h4>
    <p>Servers can get more requests than they can handle.

        Too many requests can cause timeouts and outages.

        AWS EC2 Auto Scaling allows you to add or remove EC2 instances automatically.

        It automates the capacity to the demand.

        There are two approaches:

        Dynamic scaling: responds to changing demand
        Predictive scaling: schedules the number of instances based on a predicted demand
        Dynamic and Predictive scaling can be combined to scale faster</p>
    <img src="/public/img/AWS/demand.png" alt="">
    <h1>AWS Cloud Auto Scaling</h1>
    <h4>AWS EC2 Auto Scaling</h4>
    <p>EC2 Auto Scaling can be added as a buffer on top of your instances.

        It can add new instances to the application when necessary and terminate them when no longer needed.

        You can set up a group of instances.

        Here you can set a minimum capacity of instances that will always be running. The rest will operate when
        necessary.</p>


    <p class="tip">You can set the desired number of AWS EC2 instances in the scaling group.

        However, the desired capacity defaults to your minimum capacity if not specified.</p>
    <p>The last configuration is Maximum capacity.

        Here you set the maximum capacity of instances to be used.</p>
    <p class="tip">The Auto Scaling groups allow you to have a dynamic environment.

        You set the minimum capacity, the desired number, and the maximum capacity.

        The group will operate within the config and give you a predictable and cost-effective architecture.</p>
    <h1>AWS Cloud Elastic Load Balancing</h1>
    <h4>Elastic Load Balancing</h4>
    <p>Traffic can be directed with Elastic Load Balancing.</p>
    <h4>Elastic Load Balancing Service</h4>
    <p>This service distributes application traffic across services.

        The Load Balancer is a single point of contact for incoming web traffic.

        The single point of contact means that the traffic hits the Load Balancer first, spreading out the load between
        the resources.

        The balancer accepts requests and directs them to the appropriate instances.

        It ensures that one resource won't get overloaded, and that the traffic is spread out.

        AWS EC2 and Elastic Load Balancing are two different services that work well together.</p>
    <p class="tip">AWS ELB is built to support increased traffic without increasing the hourly cost.

        AWS ELB scales automatically.</p>
    <h4>Load Allocation</h4>
    <p>The service allocates incoming traffic between the available resources.

        The principle is the same with both high and low demand periods.

        It will allocate between what is available at any time.</p>
    <h1>AWS Cloud Messaging and Queuing</h1>
    <h4>Monolithic Applications and Microservices</h4>
    <p>Applications are made of multiple components.

        The components communicate with each other.

        The communication can transmit data, fulfill requests, and keep the application running.</p>
    <h4>Monolithic Application</h4>
    <p>An architecture with tightly coupled components can be called a monolithic application.

        Components can be databases, servers, interfaces, and much more.

        A monolithic application can be vulnerable if one of the components fails.

        In the worst case, this can cause the whole service to go down.</p>
    <p class="tip">Instead, your application can be designed with an approach called microservices.

        Microservices can help to keep your service available if one component fails.</p>
    <h4>Microservices</h4>
    <p>Microservices can help to maintain the service if one component fails.

        The services can be maintained because they communicate with each other and the components are not tightly
        coupled.

        AWS has two services that can make this integration:

        AWS Simple Notification Service (AWS SNS)
        AWS Simple Queue Service (AWS SQS)
        You will learn more about them in the next chapter.</p>
    <p class="tip">The difference between the Monolithic and Microservices approach is tight coupled vs. loosely
        coupled.</p>


    <h4>AWS SNS - Simple Notification Service</h4>
    <h1>Cloud Notification Service - AWS SNS</h1>
    <p>AWS Simple Notification is also called AWS SNS

        SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a notification service.</p>
    <h4>What is AWS SNS?</h4>
    <p>SNS is a cloud service for the mass delivery of messages.

        It is a fully managed publish-subscribe messaging and mobile communication service.

        It can be event-driven, with automated services responding to triggers.

        Distributed systems and micro services can be decoupled with messaging between them through AWS SNS.

        Application-to-person messaging to users is possible with SMS, mobile push, and email.</p>
    <h4>Message Endpoints</h4>
    <p>AWS SNS can publish messages to many different endpoints:

        HTTP and HTTPS
        Email and Email-JSON
        AWS SQS
        Applications
        AWS Lambda
        SMS (depending on region</p>
    <h4>The Difference between SQS and SNS</h4>
    <p>SNS is a notification system, which pushes messages to its subscribers.

        SQS is a queuing system, and the receivers have to pull the messages to be processed and deleted from the queue.
        AWS Simple Queue Service is also called AWS SQS

        SQS is a message queuing service.

        It exchanges and stores messages between software components.

        The service adds the messages in a queue.

        Users or services pick up the messages from the queue.

        Once processed the messages gets deleted from the queue.
        SNS and SQS can works well together.</p>
    <h4>AWS SQS - Simple Queue Service
    </h4>
    <h4>Cloud Queue Service - AWS SQS</h4>
    <p>AWS Simple Queue Service is also called AWS SQS

        SQS is a message queuing service.

        It exchanges and stores messages between software components.

        The service adds the messages in a queue.

        Users or services pick up the messages from the queue.

        Once processed the messages gets deleted from the queue.</p>
    <h1>AWS Cloud Serverless</h1>
    <h4>Serverless Computing</h4>
    <p>Serverless is a service where you do not have to think about servers.

        With serverless, you only have to think about code.

        The cloud provider handles all infrastructure behind it.</p>
    <h4>The Difference between EC2 and Serverless</h4>
    <p>AWS EC2 provides virtual server instances.

        To run EC2, you must do the following:

        Provision of the virtual server instances
        Deploy your code
        Operate and maintain the servers</p>
    <img src="/public/img/AWS/differenceec2serverless.png" alt="">
    <p>Serverless requires no server management.

        Having less to think about with operating server lets you focus on the important things.

        The serverless approach is suitable for scale.

        AWS has a serverless service called AWS Lambda.</p>
    <h1>AWS Cloud Lambda</h1>
    <h4>Serverless Cloud Compute - AWS Lambda</h4>
    <p>AWS Lambda a serverless compute service.

        This service lets you run code without needing to think about servers.

        It lets you focus on what's most important, such as making a great application.

        You only pay for the compute time that you use.

        Pay for what you use translates to that you only pay when your code is running.</p>
    <h4>How AWS Lambda Works</h4>
    <p>The high-level steps to understand the concept:

        Deploy your code to Lambda
        Make the code ready to trigger an event
        The code only runs when triggered
        Pay only when your code is running

    </p>
    <p class="tip">Example:

        You can look at serverless as a car.

        You start the car to travel to your destination.

        Once you are at the destination, you stop it.

        You only used fuel when driving.

        Lambda works in the same way. The use is on-demand when you run the code.</p>
    <h4>What is AWS Lambda?</h4>
    <p>Serverless computing helps abstract the infrastructure in the cloud.

        As a result, it reduces costs and can help to increase innovation.

        AWS Lambda can be used to:

        Build and deploy apps
        Monitor and maintain apps</p>
    <h4>Back-End Code</h4>
    <p>You can run Back-End code with AWS Lambda.

        Here are some popular Back-End languages:

        Node.js - Learn Node.js

        Python - Learn Python

        Java - Learn Java

        Kotlin - Learn Kotlin

        C# - Learn C#</p>
    <h1>AWS Cloud Containers</h1>
    <h4>Containers in the AWS Cloud</h4>
    <p>Containers are popular for deploying and managing applications in the cloud.

        Containers let you package code in a single object.

        The container isolates the code and removes the dependencies to other components.

        It runs in isolation.

        Containers are an essential concept in micro service architectures.
    </p>
    <h4>Containerized Approach</h4>
    <p>Having the application in a container makes debugging easier.

        It makes it easier because the application is inside of an isolated container.

        The container remains consistent regardless of deployment.

    </p>
    <img src="/img/AWS/onehostcontainers.png" alt="">
    <h4>Containers and Scale</h4>
    <p>It is important to design for scale when using containers.

        There could be tens of hosts with hundreds of containers as the environment grows.

        One should prepare for how to manage operations at scale.</p>
    <img src="/img/AWS/manyhosts.png" alt="">
    <p class="tip">Container orchestration services help you deploy, manage, and scale your containerized applications.

    <h1>AWS Cloud Infrastructure</h1>
    <h4>Introduction AWS Infrastructure</h4>
    <p>AWS has global infrastructure with Data Centers all over the world.

        Deploy apps across the globe or to a specific location.

        Build and deploy where you want.</p>
    <p class="tip">Selecting a Data Center near your users will reduce the latency and make the experience of your
        application faster!</p>

    <h4>Introduction to AWS Global Infrastructure</h4>
    <p class="tip">AWS Data Centers all over the world.

        The network of Data Centers helps ensure the availability of your applications.

        If one of the Data Centers fails, another will carry the workload.

        The network of Data Centers communicates to make sure that your applications are kept available.</p>
    <h1>AWS Cloud Regions</h1>
    <h4>Introduction AWS Regions</h4>
    <h4>Selecting a Region</h4>
    <p>There are different reasons to choose a specific region.

        Those reasons could be:

        Data regulations
        Customer proximity
        Service availability
        Pricing</p>
    <h4>Government Regulations and Data Governance</h4>
    <p>Some countries do not allow sensitive data to be processed and stored abroad.

        Your company might require that all company data shall reside in the country.</p>
    <h4>Customer Proximity</h4>
    <p class="tip">For example:

        Imagine that your company is based in Seattle and your customers in Norway.

        You might want to consider having the infrastructure in a Data Center near you.

        Simultaneously, have the applications running in a Data Center near your customers in Norway.

        Using sites near your customers results in faster content delivery, giving them a better experience.</p>
    <h4>Region Availability Services</h4>
    <p>All AWS Data Centers do not support all services and features.

        AWS makes new services all the time.

        Making services available requires AWS to build infrastructure in the Data Centers.

        As a result, the services might not have come to a Data Center near you yet.

        You can select a region to access specific services.

    </p>
    <h1>AWS Cloud Availability Zones</h1>
    <h4>Introduction to Availability Zones</h4>
    <p>Availability Zone is a single Data Center or a group of Data Centers in a region.

        In an Availability Zone the Data Centers are located many miles apart from each other.

        Having them apart reduces the risk of them all going down if a disaster happens in the region.

        Simultaneously, have the Data Center(s) close enough to have low latency.

    </p>
    <h4>AWS Availability Zones Video</h4>
    <h4>Availability Zones Illustration</h4>
    <p>This picture illustrates how the Availability Zones works:

        Three regions (orange circles): N. California, Oregon, GovCloud(US-West).

        The regions have availability zones (blue circles) displayed as a grid around them.

        The picture zooms in on the N. California region.

        N. California has an availability zone of three groupings of Data Centers: US-West-1A, US-West-1B, and
        US-West-1C.</p>

    <img src="/img/AWS/availabilityzones.png" alt="">
    <h1>AWS Cloud Edge Locations</h1>
    <h4>Introduction Edge Locations</h4>
    <p>Edge Location is the Data Center used to deliver content fast to your users.

        It is the site that is nearest your users.</p>
    <h4>Fast Delivery</h4>
    <p>The AWS Edge Locations uses a service called CloudFront.

        CloudFront is used to store cached copies of your content.

        Resulting in fast delivery of your content.

    </p>
    <h4>What is Cache?</h4>
    <p>Caching helps the software to deliver content faster and cheaper.

        Cache is fast storage that copies and stores parts of data.

        The data is stored in hardware that can deliver content fast, for example, RAM (Random-access memory).

        The main job of the cache is to deliver content fast.

        The data is saved in the fast hardware layer so that it does not have to use the slow storage hardware.</p>
    <p class="tip">The content is delivered faster because the data is no longer requested from the primary location.

        It is delivered from the Edge Location. The location nearest to the user.</p>
    <h4>How Cache Works</h4>
    <p>The cache saves subsets of the data, making it available.

        Once someone requests the data, it is copied and stored at the Edge Location.

        When the next person requests the same data, it will be delivered faster from the nearest Edge Location.</p>
    <h1>AWS Cloud Resource Provisioning</h1>
    <h4>Ways to Interact with AWS Services</h4>
    <h4>AWS Management Console</h4>
    <p>The AWS Management Console is a web-based interface.

        It is used to access and manage AWS services.</p>
    <p class="tip">The AWS Management Console has a mobile application.

        The mobile view is best used for monitoring and accessing billing information.</p>
    <h4>AWS Command Line Interface</h4>
    <p>AWS Command Line Interface is also called "AWS CLI".

        CLI saves you time when making API requests.

        It allows you to control multiple AWS services with one tool.

        CLI allows you to automate actions on services with scripts.</p>
    <h4>Software Development Kits</h4>
    <p>Software development kits are also called "SDKs".

        SDKs is another option to access and manage AWS services.

        It eases the use of AWS services through an API.

        The API is fitted to the platform or programing language that you use.

        SDKs can be used on existing applications or new ones built on AWS.</p>
    <p class="tip">AWS SDKs supports programming languages such as C++, Java, .NET, and more.</p>
    <h1>AWS Cloud Provision Services</h1>

    <h1>AWS Cloud Connectivity</h1>
    <h4>Introduction AWS Networking</h4>
    <h4>AWS Connectivity Intro Video</h4>
    <h4>AWS Virtual Private Cloud</h4>
    <p>AWS Virtual Private Cloud is also called AWS VPC.

        VPC is a service that lets you isolate your AWS resources in an isolated network.

        The boundaries created around the resources let AWS restrict the network traffic.

        In addition, it allows you to include the sections of the AWS Cloud that you want in the isolated network.

        Resources can be organized in subnets.

        A subnet is a section in the VPC that can contain specific resources.</p>

    <h4>Internet Gateway</h4>
    <p>Public traffic can be allowed to your VPC.

        The traffic is allowed by an Internet Gateway.</p>
    <img src="/img/AWS/internetgateway.png" alt="">
    <p class="tip">An Internet Gateway is a door between the VPC and the internet.

        The traffic enters the VPC through the Internet Gateway.

        Without the Internet Gateway, you cannot access the resources in the VPC.</p>
    <h4>Virtual Private Gateway</h4>
    <p>A Virtual Private Gateway is used to access private resources in the VPC.

        It has extra layers of protection.

        The Virtual Private Gateway encrypts the internet traffic, keeping it protected.

        It is a component that allows the encrypted traffic to enter the VPC.</p>
    <img src="/img/AWS/virtualprivategateway.png" alt="">
    <p class="tip">The Virtual Private Gateway allows you to make a Virtual Private Network (VPN) between the VPC and
        private network.

        It only allows traffic from approved networks.

        Many businesses use VPNs to ensure that their traffic and data are secure.</p>
    <h4>AWS Direct Connect</h4>
    <p>AWS Direct Connect lets you make a dedicated private connection between the Data Center and a VPC.

        A dedicated connection is to have the link for yourself.

        The link is not shared with others.

        Only you and your data can travel through the connection.</p>
    <img src="/img/AWS/directconnect.png" alt="">
    <h1>AWS Cloud Subnet and Access</h1>
    <h4>Subnets and Network Access Control Lists Video</h4>
    <h4>Subnets</h4>
    <p>A Subnet is a section of a VPC.

        The Subnet allows you to group resources.

        The groupings can have different security or operations needs.

        You can have both public and private Subnets.</p>
    <h4>Public Subnets</h4>
    <p>Public Subnets have resources that the public can access.</p>
    <h4>Private Subnets</h4>
    <p>Private Subnets have resources that can only be accessed through the private network.

        For example, databases holding customer data.</p>
    <p class="tip">Public and Private Subnets can communicate with each other through secure channels.</p>
    <h4>Network Traffic in a VPC</h4>
    <p>Requested data are sent as a Packet.

        A Packet is a package of data sent over a network or the internet.

        It enters the VPC through an Internet Gateway.

        Before entering a Subnet it checks for permissions.

        Checking permissions such as:

        Who sent the Packet?
        How will the Packet communicate with the resources in the Subnet</p>
    <h4>Network Access Control Lists</h4>
    <p>Network Access Control Lists are called ACLs.

        ACL is a firewall that controls the traffic, both inbound and outbound.

        It controls the traffic at the subnet level.

        The ACL checks and controls the Packets.

        If the Packet is on the approved list, it will pass through.

        However, if they are not on the list, they will be denied access.</p>
    <h4>Stateless Packet Filtering</h4>
    <p>The ACLs do Stateless Packet filtering.

        They have no memory and will forget the request once checked.

        Their job is to check the Packets that go in and out.

        It uses the set rules to approve or deny access.</p>
    <img src="/img/AWS/statelesspacketfiltering.png" alt="">
    <h4>Security Groups</h4>
    <p>A Security Group is a firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic.

        This feature is specific for an AWS EC2 instance.</p>
    <p class="tip">The default config denies all inbound traffic and allows all outbound.

        You have to add new rules to change this config.</p>
    <h4>Stateful Packet Filtering</h4>
    <p>Security Groups do stateful Packet filtering.

        They remember the actions that they have done with Packets in the past.</p>
    <img src="/img/AWS/statelesspacketfiltering.png" alt="">
    <h4>Configuration</h4>
    <p>ACLs and Security groups can be configured.

        Configuration means adding custom rules for the traffic.</p>
    <img src="/img/AWS/overviewsecurity.png" alt="">
    <h1>AWS Cloud Global Networking
    </h1>
    <h4>Domain Name System</h4>
    <p>Domain Name System is also called DNS.

        DNS is the service that lets someone access your website from their browser.

        The DNS is like a phone book.

        It connects the IP address to the domain name.</p>
    <img src="/img/AWS/dnsoverview.png" alt="">
    <h4>AWS Route 53</h4>
    <p>Route 53 is a DNS web service.

        It routes end users to internet apps hosted in AWS.

        Route 53 connects users and their requests to AWS resources and external resources.</p>

    <p>Route 53 has a feature to manage DNS records.

        You can register new and transfer domains with Route 53.

        You can manage all of your domain names from Route 53.</p>
    <h4>Use AWS Route 53 and AWS CloudFront</h4>
    <img src="/img/AWS/route53andcloudfront.png" alt="">
    <p>The picture explained:

        The company has 3 EC2 Instances in an Auto Scaling group.

        The group is attached to an Application Load Balancer.

        User requests data from the website application.
        Route 53 uses DNS resolution to identify the IP address.
        The data is sent back to the user.
        The user request is sent to the nearest Edge Location through CloudFront.
        CloudFront connects to the Application Load Balancer.
        The Load Balancer sends the packet to the EC2 instance.

    <h1>AWS Storage and Databases</h1>
    <h4>AWS Instance Stores</h4>
    <h4>What are Instance Stores?</h4>
    <p>Instance Store is a storage volume that acts as a physical hard drive.

        It provides temporary storage for Amazon EC2 instance.

        The data in an instance store persists during the lifetime of its instance.

        If an instance reboots, data in the instance store will persist.

        When the instance hibernates or terminates, you lose any data in the instance store.</p>
    <p class="tip">If an instance starts from a stopped state, it might start on another host where the used instance
        store does not exist.

        It is recommended to avoid storing valuable data in the store instance.

        Instance Stores are good for temporary files, and data that can be easily recreated</p>
    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <img src="/img/AWS/ec2_instance_with_attached_instance_store.jpg" style="width: 50% ; " alt="">

    <h1>AWS EBS - Elastic Block Store</h1>
    <h4>What is AWS EBS?</h4>
    <p>AWS EBS is also called AWS Elastic Block Store.

        EBS is a service that provides storage volumes.

        You can use provided storage volumes in Amazon EC2 instances.

        EBS volumes are used for data that needs to persist.

        It is important to backup the data with AWS EBS snapshots.</p>
    <p class="tip">After creating an EBS volume, you can attach it to an AWS EC2 instance.

        If the EC2 instance stops or is terminated, all the data on the attached EBS volume remains.

    </p>
    <h4>What are AWS EBS Snapshots?</h4>
    <p>EBS snapshot is an incremental data backup.

        The first backup of a volume backups all the data.

        Every next backup copies only a block of data that has changed since the last snapshot.

        It saves on storage costs by not duplicating data.</p>
    <img src="/img/AWS/ebs_snapshots.jpg" alt="">
    <p class="tip">Only the data unique to that snapshot is removed when you delete a snapshot.

        If the EC2 instance stops, or is terminated, all the data on the attached EBS volume remains.</p>
    <h1>AWS S3 - Simple Storage Service</h1>
    <h4>Cloud Storage - AWS S3</h4>

        Metadata - information about what the data is
        Key - unique identifier</p>
    <img src="/img/AWS/object-storage.jpg" alt="">
    <h4>AWS S3 Storage Classes</h4>
    <p>There are many AWS S3 storage classes.

        They differ in data availability.

        How frequent data is retrieved and cost price.

    </p>
    <p>S3 Standard
        S3 Standard is ideal for data that is accessed often.

        Provides high availability for stored objects.

        It stores data in at least three Availability Zones.

        It is the most expensive class.</p>
    <h4>S3 Standard-Infrequent Access</h4>
    <p>S3 Standard-Infrequent Access is also called S3 Standard-IA

        S3 Standard-IA is ideal for data that is often accessed.

        It has the same level of data availability as S3 Standard.

        It stores data in at least three Availability Zones.

        Lower storage price but higher data retrieval price.

        It is higher priced than other classes.</p>
    <h4>S3 One Zone-IA (S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access)</h4>
    <p>It stores data in one Availability Zone.

        It is cheaper than S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA classes.</p>
    <h4>S3 Intelligent-Tiering</h4>
    <p>S3 Intelligent-Tiering requires automation and monitoring.

        It is recommended for data with unknown or frequently changing access.

        It moves the object to the S3 Standard-IA class if it is not accessed for 30 days.

        It moves objects to S3 Standard if accessed in S3 Standard-IA or S3 One Zone-IA classes.</p>
    <h4>S3 Glacier</h4>
    <p>S3 Glacier is recommended for archiving data.

        It can retrieve objects within a few minutes.

        S3 Glacier is a cheaper and slower class.

    </p>
    <h4>S3 Glacier Deep Archive</h4>
    <p>S3 Glacier Deep Archive has the lowest cost.

        Like S3 Glacier, it is best for archives.

        Compared to S3 Glacier, S3 Glacier Deep Archive can retrieve objects within 12 hours.</p>

        <h1>C Basic Tags</h1>
        <p>
            C is a procedural programming language. It was developed by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in the year 1972. Despite being old C is a very popular language among programmers. It is a very fast language compared to other languages like Python, Java, etc.

        <p>
            Below is the basic syntax structure of the C program:
            <img src="/img/Clanguage.png" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>
            The basic syntax of the C program consists of the header, main() function, variable declaration, body, and return type of the program.<br>

            The header is the first line in the C program with extension .h which contains macro definitions and C functions. <br>
            Programs must contain the main() function because execution in C programming starts from the main().<br>
            Variable declaration in C is done inside the main function and can be used in the body anywhere but before the main, we can also declare variables which are known as Global variables. <br>
            In the body of the function, we perform operations required inside the function like printing, sum, average, sorting, searching, etc.<br>
            The last part of the C program is the return statement which refers to returning values of the program. If the return type is void then there will be no return statement.
        </p>
        <p>
            // Basic Syntax of C Program<br>
            #include <stdio.h><br>

            // main function<br>
            int main()<br>
            {<br>

                // body<br>
                printf("Hi! This is a basic C program.");<br>

                // return statement<br>
                return 0;<br>
            }
        </p>
        <h2>Output:</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! This is a basic C program.
        </p>
        <h2>Tokens</h2>
        <p>
            A token in C programming is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. Letâ€™s get a good understanding of tokens through a print statement in C language.<br>
            printf("GeeksforGeeks\n");
        </p>
        <p>
            Individual tokens from the above syntax are:<br>
            printf<br>
            (<br>
            "GeeksforGeeks\n"<br>
            )<br>
            ;
        </p>
        <h2>Semicolons:</h2>
        <p>
            In C programming Semicolon is used to show the termination of Instruction. It is also called a statement terminator since every single statement should be ended with a semicolon. Semicolons are used to end statements in C.

            The Semicolon tells the compiler that the current statement has been terminated. If any statement in the Program ends without a semicolon, then the program will not compile and will generate an error message.
        </p>
        <p>
            // C program to demonstrate use of Semicolon<br>
            #include <stdio.h><br>

            int main() { printf("GeeksforGeeks") return 0; }

        </p>

            <h4>SQL</h4>
            <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is the most popular language for managing data.

                Knowledge of SQL databases, tables and queries helps data scientists when dealing with data.
                
                SQL is very convenient for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data in databases.
                
                </p>
                <h1>Machine Learning Examples</h1>
                <h4>Artificial Music Intelligence</h4>
                <p>Can an algorithm compose better music than a human?

                    David Cope is a former professor of music at the University of Santa Cruz (California).
                    
                    For over 30 years, David Cope has been developing Emmy or EMI (Experimental Musical Intelligence), an algorithm to compose music in the style of famous composers.</p>
                    <h4>Bach, Larson, or EMI?</h4>
                    <p>In a test performed by professor Douglas Hofstadter of the University of Oregon, a pianist performed three musical pieces in the style of Bach:

                        One written by Bach
                        One written by Steve Larson
                        One written by EMI
                        Dr. Larson was hurt when the audience concluded that his piece was written by EMI.
                        
                        He felt better when the listeners decided that the piece composed by EMI was a genuine Bach.</p>

                                    <h4>Linear</h4>
                                    <p>Linear means straight. A linear graph is a straight line.

                                        The graph consists of two axes: x-axis (horizontal) and y-axis (vertical).</p>
                                        <h4>Slope</h4>
                                        <p>The slope is the angle of the graph.

                                            The slope is the a value in a linear graph:
                                            
                                            y = ax
                                            
                                            In this example, slope = 1.2:</p>

                                            <p>The Intercept is the start value of the graph.

                                                The intercept is the b value in a linear graph:
                                                
                                                y = ax + b

                                                            <p>Frank Rosenblatt (1928 – 1971) was an American psychologist notable in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

                                                                In 1957 he started something really big. He "invented" a Perceptron program, on an IBM 704 computer at Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory.
                                                                
                                                                Scientists had discovered that brain cells (Neurons) receive input from our senses by electrical signals.
                                                                
                                                                The Neurons, then again, use electrical signals to store information, and to make decisions based on previous input.

                                                                <h4>The Perceptron</h4>
                                                                <p>The original Perceptron was designed to take a number of binary inputs, and produce one binary output (0 or 1).

                                                                    The idea was to use different weights to represent the importance of each input, and that the sum of the values should be greater than a threshold value before making a decision like yes or no (true or false) (0 or 1).</p>

<h1>Pattern Recognition</h1>
<p class="tip">Neural Networks are used in applications like Facial Recognition.

    These applications use Pattern Recognition.
    
    This type of Classification can be done with a Perceptron.
    
    Perceptrons can be used to classify data into two parts.
    
    Perceptrons are also known as a Linear Binary Classifiers.</p>
    <h4>Pattern Classification</h4>
    <p>Imagine a strait line (a linear graph) in a space with scattered x y points.

        How can you classify the points over and under the line?

        <h4>How to Program a Perceptron</h4>
        <p>To program a perceptron, we can use a simple JavaScript program that will:

            Create a simple plotter
            Create 500 random x y points
            Display the x y points
            Create a line function: f(x)
            Display the line
            Compute the desired answers

                    <p>Create a Perceptron object. Name it anything (like Perceptron).

                        Let the perceptron accept two parameters:
                        
                        The number of inputs (no)
                        The learning rate (learningRate).
                        Set the default learning rate to 0.00001.
                        
                        Then create random weights between -1 and 1 for each input.</p>
                        <p class="tip">The Random Weights
                            The Perceptron will start with a random weight for each input.</p>
                            <p class="tip">The Learning Rate
                                For each mistake, while training the Perceptron, the weights will be adjusted with a small fraction.

                                    To avoid this, we give the perceptron an extra input with the value of 1.
                                    
                                    This is called a bias.</p>

                                                <h4>Gradient Descent</h4>
                                                <p>Gradient Descent is a popular algorithm for solving AI problems.

                                                    A simple Linear Regression Model can be used to demonstrate a gradient descent.
                                                    
                                                    The goal of a linear regression is to fit a linear graph to a set of (x,y) points. This can be solved with a math formula. But a Machine Learning Algorithm can also solve this.
                                                    
                                                    This is what the example above does.
                                                    
                                                    It starts with a scatter plot and a linear model (y = wx + b).
                                                    
                                                    Then it trains the model to find a line that fits the plot. This is done by altering the weight (slope) and the bias (intercept) of the line.</p>
                                                    <h4>A Trainer Object</h4>
                                                    <p>Create a Trainer object that can take any number of (x,y) values in two arrays (xArr,yArr).

                                                        Set weight to zero and the bias to 1.
                                                        
                                                        A learning constant (learnc) has to be set, and a cost variable must be defined:</p>
                                                        <h4>Cost Function</h4>
                                                        <p>A standard way to solve a regression problem, is with an "Cost Function" that measures how good the solution is.

                                                            The function uses the weight and bias from the model (y = wx + b) and returns an error, based on how well the line fits a plot.
                                                            
                                                            The way to compute this error, is to loop through all (x,y) points in the plot, and sum the square distances between the y value of each point and the line.
                                                            
                                                            The most conventional way is to square the distances (to ensure positive values) and to make the error function differentiable.</p>

<h4>Machine Learning Training</h4>
<p>The goal of training is to create a model that can answer a question. Like what is the expected price for a house?

</p>
<h4>Machine Learning Inference</h4>
<p>Inference is when the trained model is used to infer (predict) values using live data. Like putting the model into production.</p>
<h4>Supervised Learning</h4>
<p>Supervised learning uses labeled data (data with known answers) to train algorithms to:

    Classify Data
    Predict Outcomes
    Supervised learning can classify data like "What is spam in an e-mail", based on known spam examples.
    
    Supervised learning can predict outcomes like predicting what kind of video you like, based on the videos you have played.</p>
    <h4>Unsupervised Learning</h4>
    <p>Unsupervised learning is used to predict undefined relationships like meaningful patterns in data.

        It is about creating computer algorithms than can improve themselves.
        
        It is expected that machine learning will shift to unsupervised learning to allow programmers to solve problems without creating models.</p>
        <h4>Reinforcement Learning</h4>
        <p>Reinforcement learning is based on non-supervised learning but receives feedback from the user whether the decisions is good or bad. The feedback contributes to improving the model.

        </p>

<h4>Self-Supervised Learning</h4>
<p>Self-supervised learning is similar to unsupervised learning because it works with data without human added labels.

    The difference is that unsupervised learning uses clustering, grouping, and dimensionality reduction, while self-supervised learning draw its own conclusions for regression and classification tasks.</p>
<h1>Machine Learning Data</h1>
<p class="tip">Up to 80% of a Machine Learning project is about Collecting Data:

    What data is Required?
    What data is Available?
    How to Select the data?
    How to Collect the data?
    How to Clean the data?
    How to Prepare the data?
    How to Use the data?</p>
    <h4>What is Data?</h4>
    <p>Data can be many things.

        With Machine Learning, data is collections of facts:
        
        Type	Examples
        Numbers	Prices. Dates.
        Measurements	Size. Height. Weight.
        Words	Names and Places.
        Observations	Counting Cars.
        Descriptions	It is cold.</p>
        <h4>Intelligence Needs Data</h4>
        <p>Human intelligence needs data:

            A real estate broker needs data about sold houses to estimate prices.
            
            Artificial Intelligence also needs data:
            
            A Machine Learning program needs data to estimate prices.</p>
            <p class="tip">Data can help us to see and understand.

                Data can help us to find new opportunities.
                
                Data can help us to resolve misunderstandings.</p>
                <h4>Storing Data</h4>
                <p>The most common data to collect are Numbers and Measurements.

                    Often data are stored in arrays representing the relationship between values.

                        15 meters
                        35 children
                        Qualitative data are descriptive:
                        
                        It is cold
                        It is long

<p>A Population is group of individuals (objects) we want to collect information from.

    A Census is information about every individual in a population.
    
    A Sample is information about a part of the population (In order to represent all).</p>
    <h4>Random Samples</h4>
    <p>In order for a sample to represent a population, it must be collected randomly.

        A Random Sample, is a sample where every member of the population has an equal chance to appear in the sample.</p>
        <h4>Sampling Bias</h4>
        <p>A Sampling Bias (Error) occurs when samples are collected in such a way that some individuals are less (or more) likely to be included in the sample.

        </p>
        <h4>Big Data</h4>
        <p>Big data is data that is impossible for humans to process without the assistance of advanced machines.

            Big data does not have any definition in terms of size, but datasets are becoming larger and larger as we continously collect more and more data and store data at a lower and lower cost.</p>
            <h1>Data Clusters</h1>
            <p class="tip">Clusters are collections of similar data
                Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning
                The Correlation Coefficient describes the strength of a relationship.</p>
                <h4>Clusters</h4>
                <p>Clusters are collections of data based on similarity.

                    Data points clustered together in a graph can often be classified into clusters.
                    
                    In the graph below we can distinguish 3 different clusters:</p>

                    <img src="/img/AWS/download (5).png" alt="">
                    <h4>Identifying Clusters</h4>
                    <p>Clusters can hold a lot of valuable information, but clusters come in all sorts of shapes, so how can we recognize them?

                        The two main methods are:
                        
                        Using Visualization
                        Using an Clustering Algorithm</p>
                        <h4>Clustering</h4>
                        <p>Clustering is a type of Unsupervised Learning.

                            Clustering is trying to:
                            
                            Collect similar data in groups
                            Collect dissimilar data in other groups</p>
                            <h4>Clustering Methods</h4>
<p>Density Method
    Hierarchical Method
    Partitioning Method
    Grid-based Method
    The Density Method considers points in a dense regions to have more similarities and differences than points in a lower dense region. The density method has a good accuracy. It also has the ability to merge clusters.
    Two common algorithms are DBSCAN and OPTICS.
    
    The Hierarchical Method forms the clusters in a tree-type structure. New clusters are formed using previously formed clusters.
    Two common algorithms are CURE and BIRCH.
    
    The Grid-based Method formulates the data into a finite number of cells that form a grid-like structure.
    Two common algorithms are CLIQUE and STING
    
    The Partitioning Method partitions the objects into k clusters and each partition forms one cluster.
    One common algorithm is CLARANS.</p>
    <h1>Linear Regressions</h1>
    <p class="tip">A Regression is a method to determine the relationship between one variable (y) and other variables (x).

        In statistics, a Linear Regression is an approach to modeling a linear relationship between y and x.
        
        In Machine Learning, a Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm.</p>

        <h1>Deep Learning (DL)</h1>
        <p class="tip">The deep learning revolution started around 2010.

            Since then, Deep Learning has solved many "unsolvable" problems.
            
            The deep learning revolution was not started by a single discovery. It more or less happened when several needed factors were ready:
            
            Computers were fast enough
            Computer storage was big enough
            Better training methods were invented
            Better tuning methods were invented</p>
            <h4>Neurons</h4>
            <p>Scientists agree that our brain has between 80 and 100 billion neurons.

                These neurons have hundreds of billions connections between them.
                
                </p>
                <p>Neurons (aka Nerve Cells) are the fundamental units of our brain and nervous system.

                    The neurons are responsible for receiving input from the external world, for sending output (commands to our muscles), and for transforming the electrical signals in between.</p>
<h4>Neural Networks</h4>
<p>Artificial Neural Networks are normally called Neural Networks (NN).

    Neural networks are in fact multi-layer Perceptrons.
    
    The perceptron defines the first step into multi-layered neural networks.
    
    Neural Networks is the essence of Deep Learning.
    
    Neural Networks is one of the most significant discoveries in history.
    
    Neural Networks can solve problems that can NOT be solved by algorithms:
    
    Medical Diagnosis
    Face Detection
    Voice Recognition</p>
    <h4>The Neural Network Model</h4>
    <img src="/img/AWS/img_neural_networks.jpg" alt="">
    <h4>The Giraffe Story</h4>
    <p>In 2015, Matthew Lai, a student at Imperial College in London created a neural network called Giraffe.

        Giraffe could be trained in 72 hours to play chess at the same level as an international master.
        
        Computers playing chess are not new, but the way this program was created was new.
        
        Smart chess playing programs take years to build, while Giraffe was built in 72 hours with a neural network.</p>

            <h1>Brain.js</h1>
            <p class="tip">Brain.js is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to understand Neural Networks because it hides the complexity of the mathematics.</p>
<p>Example Explained:
    A Neural Network is created with: new brain.NeuralNetwork()
    
    The network is trained with network.train([examples])
    
    The examples represent 4 input values with a corresponding output value.
    
    With network.run([1,0]), you ask "What is the likely output of [1,0]?"
    
    The answer from the network is:
    
    one: 93% (close to 1)
    zero: 6% (close to 0)

        <h1>Human Intelligence</h1>
        <p class="tip">About 70 000 years ago, something happened to the human brain.

            Humans started to develop "Cognitive Intelligence":
            
            Being able to understand a language
            Being able to understand numbers
            Being able to understand abstract thinking</p>
            <h4>Words and Numbers</h4>
            <p>Using words, was a big step in the development of human intelligence:

                "Elephant" is more informative than "Big Animal".
                
                Understanding numbers, was also a big step:
                
                "5" or "50" is more informative than "few" or "many".</p>
                <h4>Languages</h4>
                <p>"There is a lion behind the big oak" is more informative than shouting "Danger!".

                    Having a language is probably a key characteristic that distinguishes us from animals.</p>
                    <h4>Abstract Thinking</h4>

                    <p>Many everyday behaviors use abstract thinking:

                        Using Concepts
                        Using Theories
                        Using Metaphors

                        <p>There is no proven definition of Intelligence.

                            Intelligence can be defined as:
                            
                            Being able to understand abstract thinking

                            Being able to understand numbers
                            Intelligence can be defined as a collection of knowledge:</p>
                            <p>The challenge of AI is to understand what intelligence is, and how intelligence works.

                                What is the difference between human knowledge and artificial intelligence?
                                
                                Intelligence might be a type of algorithms in our brains or in our genes.
                                
                                Later in this tutorial you will learn more about intelligent algorithms.</p>

                                <p>Can animals, birds, insects, or plants think?

                                    Humans have bigger brains than animals.
                                    
                                    Big dogs have bigger brains than small dogs. Are big dogs smarter?
                                    
                                    Birds have very small brains, but they know they should not make children in the autumn, and they know when to fly to the south.
                                    
                                    Bees have even smaller brains, but they know how to communicate about where to find nectar.
                                    
                                    Plants have no brain, but they know how to reproduce, and how to prepare for the winter.</p>
                                    <h1>The History of Languages</h1>
                                    <p>A language is a structured system of communication.

                                        The type of communication that involves the use of words.</p>
                                        <h4>What is a Language?</h4>
                                        <p>Apes and Whales communicate with each other.

                                            Birds and Bees communicate with each other.
                                            
                                            But only humans have developed a real Language.
                                            
                                            No other species can express ideas using sentences constructed by a set of words (with verbs and nouns).
                                            
                                            This skill is remarkable. And what is even more remarkable: Even children master this skill.</p>
                                            <h4>Spoken Languages</h4>
                                            <p>We are not sure of how old the spoken language is. The topic is difficult to study because of the lack of evidence.

                                                We don't know how it started. But we have a clue.
                                                
                                                The great African apes, Pan and Gorilla, are our closest living relatives. Why are they called "Apes"? Because they ape. Apes mime to get their message across.
                                                
                                                It is assumed that the evolution of languages must have been a long process. Our ancestors might have started speaking a million years ago, but with fewer words, more miming, and no grammar.</p>
<h4>Cognitive Development</h4>
<p>According to Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch (2002), there are six aspects of language development:

    Theory of Mind
    Understanding Vocal Signals
    Understanding Imitation
    Understanding Numbers
    Understanding Intentional Communication
    Understanding Non-linguistic Representations

    <h1>The History of Numbers</h1>
    <p class="tip">To understand AI, it is important to understand the concept of Numbers and Counting.</p>
    <h4>AI is About Numbers</h4>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence is all about Numbers.

        Numbers are easy to understand: 1,2,3,4,5 ... 11,12,13,14,15.
        
        Studies of animals indicates that even animals can understand some numbers:
        
        2 Wives
        8 Sons
        5 Eggs
        The need for numbers in the modern world is absolute. We cannot live without numbers:
        
        100 Dollar
        Pi = 3.14
        365 Days
        25 Years
        20% Tax
        100 Miles</p>
        <h4>AI is About Counting</h4>
<p>The concept of numbers leads to the concept of counting.

    Imagine prehistoric thinking:
    
    How to count apples?
    How to weigh corn?
    How to pay?
    How far is the ocean?
    Artificial Intelligence is a result of the human need for calculations.
    
    Counting is easy to understand: 2 + 2 = 4.
    
    Studies of animals indicates that animals can only understand very simple counting.
    
    How do Homo Sapiens deal with calculations?
    
    Complex calculations are done by computers.</p>

        Computer Speed</p>
        <p>The First Abacus
            The Babylonian Abacus was developed to Reduce the Time to perform calculations.
            
            As stated in the previous chapter, we believe that the Babylonians invented complex counting.
            
            The period 2700–2300 BC probably saw the first appearance of an abacus, a table of successive columns which defined the orders of a 60 digits number system.</p>

<h4>Abacus 2.0</h4>

<h4>Analog Computers</h4>
<p>The Difference Engine (Charles Babbage 1822) was a mechanical machine designed to Reduce the Time to calculate complex mathematical functions.

    The Analytical Engine (Charles Babbage 1833) was a mechanical machine designed with modern computer elements like arithmetic, logic, and memory.
    
    Both these "computers" used 10 digit (decimal) mechanical cogwheels to perform mathematical calculations:</p>

        Artificial Intelligence Robots</p>
        <h4>Industrial Robots</h4>
        <p>Industrial robots have been around for more than 50 years.

            The first robot patent was applied for in 1954 and granted in 1961.
            
            In 1969, Victor Scheinman invented the Stanford Arm (Stanford University), and in 1972 he designed the MIT Arm for the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab.

            <h4>AI Robots</h4>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence can be built into robots, and AI is a very exciting field in future robotics.

                Hanson Robotics' Sophia personifies some dreams for the future of AI.
                
                Sophia is a combination of science, engineering, and artistry. She is a human-crafted science fiction character depicting the future of AI and robotics.</p>

                                        Most observations are within 1 standard deviation from the mean.
                                        
                                        Almost all observations are within 2 standard deviations.
                                        
                                        Practically all observations are within 3 standard deviations.
                                        
                                        Normal Distribution Facts
                                        Normal distribution is Symmetric. The peak always divides the distribution in half.
                                        
                                        Normal distribution is a Probability distribution.
                                        
                                        A lot of observations follow the normal distribution:

                                        <p class="tip">Probability is about how Likely something is to occur, or how likely something is true.

                                            The mathematic probability is a Number between 0 and 1.
                                            
                                            0 indicates Impossibility and 1 indicates Certainty.</p>
                                            <h4>The Probability of an Event</h4>
                                            <p class="tip">The probability of an event is:

                                                The number of ways the event can happen / The number of possible outcomes.
                                                
                                                Probability = # of Ways / Outcomes</p>
